# Description:
# This program is like the sorting hat for the Harry Potter book series.
# The program allows the user to see who is in each house all at once or a single
# house at a time. It also allows the user to sort themselves into a house using
# a random number generator.
# Collaboration:
# I collaborated with Harsh Patel (harsh3@umbc.edu). He helped me understand how to approach and the
# logic behind this assignment. He also helped me understand my error with converting to a dictionary.
